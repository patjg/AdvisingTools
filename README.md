# AdvisingTools

A C++ console application that is intended to automate several collegiate academic advising tasks. Current plan functionality includes the following:

1) Ability to read files containing student data into a map of maps to be manipulated by the user
2) Functions that search based on various criteria including returning a user provided column, defining columns headers, and searching multiple columns for user-provided strings (I imagine this will be most useful in finding missing advisors or finding multiple advisors)
3) Eventually (very early in development) will accept a student transcript or list of student classes en masse to determine if prerequisite courses have been completed for a student's proposed courses or their registered courses
4) Return a list of students based on GPA cutoffs to simplify reaching out to students of concern. 

Very early in development currently and new to programming, this project is being built both because it will be useful in my daily work and as a learning opportunity for me.
